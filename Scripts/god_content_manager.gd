		"The rational, logical, harmonious, musical, healing and golden god of Olympus. The tales that survive regarding him are somewhat at odds with the glowing descriptions of his character. Just ask Daphne transformed into a Laurel to escape his pursuits. Or Hyacinthus whom he accidently struck (and killed) with a discus. Or his jealous mess of a relationship with Coronis of which you will learn of in this game. Or the flaying of Marsyas the satyr after their musical competition. Or his spiteful treatment of Cassandra when she rejected him. Or his impulsive slaying of the cyclopes. Or his vicious eradication of the sons of Niobe. But you know outside of those he's a really chill, down to earth, sensible dude. I promise.",

Well; Actaeon, Callisto, Orion, The daughters of Niobe, the people of Calydon, Iphigenia, Otis and Ephialte, have had the pleasure. The protectress of the chase and the chaste is most clearly remembered for her aptitude for enacting revenge. At times, the direction and force of said revenge could be random, arbitrary, even nonsensical. Plain old boring tit for tat reprisal did occur regularly enough too. This dichotomy speaks to the obvious, gods are made in our image not the inverse. Who hasn't seen someone drenched in vengeance but pointed at the wrong target and blind to it?",

		"Mercurial quick silver. Wildly intelligent from birth these days he would be called a; genius, phenom, prodigy, savant or some such. Mythologically he features more so as the messenger than the mess. Chaotic neutral would be a fair description. The slaying of Argus would show he's not above being directly involved and harshly lethal. He stands as a patron saint of tricksters and thieves, but specifically the sort of trickery that treads the boundary of justification. Think Robin Hood. Speaking of boundaries, his role as Archpsychopomp or chief conductor of souls finds him literally between life and death.",

That being said; can you really blame loving someone so hard their absence causes winter of the soul? Thus the natural flow of the seasons arose with grief followed by joy. Life by death by life. It's interesting to note that Demeter (and Hestia) had more shrines dedicated to them than the more glamorous gods. It doesn't take long to see that you only need Hephaestus to calm a volcano rarely but hoping the food would grow would be a more constant concern.",
